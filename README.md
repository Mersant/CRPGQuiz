# CRPG Quiz
 
 This is a simple quiz about CRPGs. The user has 60 seconds to answer all of the questions. Every time they get an answer wrong, 10 seconds is subtracted from the clock. Once the time runs out, it's game over. Every quiz question has a related factoid I painstakingly wrote that displays after a question is answered. The timer is paused so the user may read the factoid, of course. 
 
 Following completion of the quiz, the user's score is stored in localStorage and then displayed on the highscores.html page. The user may add their name to an unsorted hall of fame if they wish. The hall of fame is also stored in localStorage so they may save their scores for some time if they wish. It's fun for the whole family!
